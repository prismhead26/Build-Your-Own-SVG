# Build Your Own SVG
  
  ## Description:
  The main goal of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The applications prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of Inquirer, Scalable Vector Graphics, and asynchronous functions. I also learned how to use Jest, a unit testing framework, and enjoyed the ability to test locally and view the results to improve production efficiency. And lastly I sure learned .gitignore after remaking this repo a few times to prevent the node modules folder.
